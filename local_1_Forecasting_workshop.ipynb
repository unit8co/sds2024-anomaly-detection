    "`TimeSeries` is the main data class in Darts. A `TimeSeries` represents a univariate or multivariate time series, with a proper time index. The time index can either be of type `pandas.DatetimeIndex` (containing datetimes), or of type `pandas.RangeIndex` (containing integers; useful for representing sequential data without specific timestamps). `TimeSeries` can also represent *probabilistic* series, which are generated when performing a probabilistic/stochastic forecast. In this case the `TimeSeries` holds multiple samples per time step and column, from which we can obtain confidence intervals, or characteristics of the distribution. \n",

    "- For **classic models** (`ARIMA`, ...) the model needs to be **retrained** at each step. It uses the past of the moving forecasting point for training. This can take quite a while to compute.\n",
