The time index can either be of type `pandas.DatetimeIndex` (containing datetimes), or of type `pandas.RangeIndex` (containing integers; useful for representing sequential data without specific timestamps). `TimeSeries` can also represent *probabilistic* series, which are generated when performing a probabilistic/stochastic forecast. In this case the `TimeSeries` holds multiple samples per time step and column, from which we can obtain confidence intervals, or characteristics of the distribution. \n",
